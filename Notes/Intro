1)What is Express
- Minimalist FrameWork for Node.js
- It's a Server Side FrameWork

2)Why use Express
- Makes building web applications with Node.js MUCH easier
- Used for both server rendered apps as well as API/Microservices
- Full control of request and response


3)Basic Route Handling
- Handling requests/routes is simple
- app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc
- Access to params, query strings, url parts, etc
- Express has a router so we can store routes in a
  Separate file and export
- We can parse incoming data with body parser


4)Express Middleware
- Middleware functions are the functions that have access to request and response object
- Middleware can do the following
- Make changes to request/response objects
- End response cycle --- NOTE
- Call next middleware in stack
